# TrafficSignDetection
Traffic Signal Detection project using classical CV, traditional ML, and YOLO deep learning models. We train, tune, and compare multiple models (YOLOv8n/s/m) on a custom dataset, evaluating mAP, precision, and recall. Includes experiments, hyperparameter tuning, and inference demos.
